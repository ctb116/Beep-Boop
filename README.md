# _Beep-Boop_

#### _Week 2 Review for Epicodus, 8.17.2018_

#### By _**Catherine Bradley**_

## Description

_This is an interactive webpage designed to demonstrate my skills using Loops and Arrays with JavaScript and jQuery. I use for() and forEach() to separately process multiple values entered at one time. I also use JavaScript method .include() to check arrays for specific values. Additionally I use personal CSS styling to give the webpage a Space Odyssey theme._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository_
* _Open the Index.html file in Chrome web browser_

_This webpage will likely work as expected in any web browser but specifically was designed for Chrome._

## Known Bugs

* _If a letters are entered an alert will ask for a number to be inputted and the program will stop. However, if a number is entered first, followed by a space and then letter(s), the program will give the expected alert but continue the program with the first given number._

* _If separate numbers are entered and at least one is divisible by 3 then specification 1 will proceed as usual. However, the other numbers will also appear in the order they were entered._
